What’s more important than adjusting the software to your needs and viewing it considering your personal preferences?

In ExamJet you can enter your company and contact details, and also upload the logo, which then will be available in all common places. The information will be available in reports too.

You can use Account Management to adjust these settings.

**Keep in mind that only administrators are allowed to change these details.**

Go to Settings and then choose Account Defaults. Here you can set the following information:

1.  Company name
2.  Company domain
3.  Company address
4.  City
5.  State
6.  Zip
7.  Country
8.  Email
9.  Phone number

Then, switch to the Branding section and upload the logo.

Now all reports will reflect your company details.
