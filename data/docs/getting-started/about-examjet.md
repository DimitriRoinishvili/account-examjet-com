## Component dependency on each other

Some components are dependent on another one but others can work independently.

For example, the Questions and Students components have no dependency. You can create question banks, and edit questions and scenarios without any hustle. Also, you can edit student-related information and move them into different groups freely.

But, the Tests component needs the information from the Questions and Students component to create and publish the test. Therefore the Tests component depends on the information stored there.

And, lastly, the Analytics component collects information from all other components and provides reports and insights.
