To create and publish your first test in ExamJet, you need to follow some steps:

1.  First, you need to create a question bank and add questions to it
2.  Then, you should have prepared a list of students who will be allowed to take the test
3.  Based on the information above, you can create a test

**So, open Manager, and let’s do it step-by-step.**

## Create a question bank

You will find Questions on the main menu, click on it, and then select “Create question bank”.

### Question Banks

Now, you are going to choose desired question banks in the category Question Banks. ExamJet will generate the test questions based on that data.

1.  Set the total number of questions generated test should contain. This is the number how many questions should the student see (1)
2.  Press the Add Question Bank and select previously created one (2). The question bank will appear in the Question Banks list
3.  Now, based on the Question Selection option, which is located on the same page, you should select the number of the question you need to get from that question bank
4.  Let’s say, you have added only one question bank, ExamJet should get questions only from that one
5.  Select the question bank and press the edit icon, then type “100” and press the save button

Now, ExamJet will generate the test questions based on that question bank only.

### Student Groups

The Student Groups category is the place where you choose student groups who should take the test.

There is the field - Attempt Limit (1), which defines how many times the student can take that exam.

To select student groups - click the Add Student Group button and select the previously created one (2).

## Publish the Test

Publishing the test means making it available to the public.

When publishing, ExamJet will generate the test based on the provided information.

The test will contain questions that are available in question banks during publishing. So, if you modify question bank data (add or edit questions in it) it will not affect the test itself.

After you publish the test, you will see the option to provide access codes to students.

Consider access codes as one-time passwords, which are valid for that test only.

That’s it. Now students can take the test.
