In the education world, assessment is defined as means by which learners are evaluated to measure their knowledge and skills. Without assessments, teachers would not be able to properly educate their students due to a lack of essential student data.

Assessment data inform teachers as to where their students are, what they need to progress, and how to help them get to where they need to be.

Assessment is a crucial aspect of education, as using a variety of assessment types, educators can gain a more comprehensive understanding of their students, and therefore tailor their teaching methods to better suit their needs.

## **Why diversify assessment types?**

Using a balanced selection of assessment types allows educators to gather data for a more detailed understanding of their student's strengths and weaknesses. There are a variety of assessments that can provide different insights and data points.

![Assessment types](/images/blog/14/14-Why-diversify-assessment-types.webp)

Educators should strive to use a combination of formative, summative, diagnostic, norm-referenced, criterion-referenced, performance, self, peer, choice, and creative assessments. This encourages a more holistic understanding of students' areas of mastery and those that need improvement.

Diversifying assessment types also results in a more accurate evaluation of student ability. Different types of assessment can measure different aspects of learning—whether it is by subject, skill, or concept—and provide a more complete picture of student understanding.

For example, a multiple-choice test may measure students' recall of a certain topic, but it may not effectively measure their ability to apply that knowledge in a real-life application. By incorporating performance assessments, such as hands-on projects and labs, educators can gain a more accurate understanding of how well students can apply their knowledge and skills in different contexts.

Using a variety of assessment types can also promote student engagement and motivation. When students have the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding and knowledge in different ways, they can feel more connected to the material and more motivated to learn—especially if choice and creativity are involved.

Now, let's look at some of the roles of different assessment types in education, and how they can help unlock student potential.

## Diagnostic assessment

Diagnostic assessments are used to identify where students are at the beginning of a learning process. Diagnostic assessments usually take the form of pre-assessments, prior knowledge tests, and skills inventories.

As they are usually administered before any instruction begins, the results of these assessments determine what students already know and what they need to learn. Teachers often use diagnostic assessments to produce reliable baseline data to inform future instruction.

This information is then used to create a personalized learning plan for each student that is tailored to their needs. For example, a diagnostic assessment may reveal that a student struggles with a basic scientific concept. So, the teacher will now create targeted support to help the student master this skill before moving on to a new skill that requires mastery of what comes before.

Diagnostic assessments are also useful for tracking student progress over time. By administering the same diagnostic assessment at the beginning and end of a unit of study or learning segment, teachers can monitor student growth or struggle.

## Norm-referenced assessment

Norm-referenced assessments are a type of assessment that evaluates student performance about a sample of other students—a norm group. These assessments are used to determine a student's relative standing or rank among their peers.

The scores from these assessments are usually reported in terms of a percentile rank: indicating the percentage of students who scored lower than a particular student. They are often used to identify students who are performing above or below average and to make decisions about student promotion, placement, or graduation.

These tests can help identify students needing additional support, intervention, and special education services. These assessments can help to identify students who are performing below average and provide information that can be used to determine necessary resources for these students. Additionally, norm-referenced assessments can be used to identify students who may need advanced or gifted programs, to make sure they are appropriately challenged.

Norm-referenced assessments provide a way to compare student performance to a national or regional sample. Standardized tests and aptitude tests are typical norm-referenced assessments. For example, college admissions exams and state testing are often administered to large groups of students and are designed to measure student learning about previous results of past students.

This allows for a more objective measure of student outcomes. Additionally, norm-referenced assessments can be used to identify differences among schools or districts, leading to decisions about curriculum and instruction.

## Criterion-referenced assessment

Criterion-referenced assessments evaluate student outcomes based on a set of predetermined criteria or standards. These assessments are designed to measure student understanding and mastery of a specific set of skills and knowledge on a specific level.

![Criterion-referenced assessment](/images/blog/14/17.webp)

Multiple-choice tests, short-answer questions, and performance tasks can all be criterion-referenced, so long as their purpose is to compare student data to a set of standards.

Criterion-referenced assessments provide a clear and objective measure of student achievement. Typically, these assessments are given to ensure consistent and fair evaluation of student achievement.

Additionally, these assessments can be used to track student progress over time and to determine whether or not students are meeting the expectations set by the standards.

Oftentimes, these assessments are used to create a more transparent and inclusive educational system. These assessments are based on publicly available standards, allowing for greater accountability and transparency in education.

Although this point is controversial among educational institutions, criterion-referenced assessments can be used to ensure that all students are held to the same high standards, regardless of their background or abilities.

## **Formative vs summative assessments**

Both formative and summative assessments work together to provide data on individual students to inform teacher decision-making moving forward. Each assessment type plays an essential role in the learning process.

![Formative vs summative assessments](/images/blog/14/18.webp)

**Formative assessment**

A formative assessment is an ongoing process that occurs throughout the learning process. It is used to identify students' strengths and weaknesses along the way and to provide formative feedback that can be used to improve student learning before a final assessment.

Formative assessments are often described as an "assessment _for_ learning" because it is used to improve learning and instruction rather than to evaluate it. It is not used to grade student progress, but rather to provide actionable data on which prerequisite skills students already have and what they still need to learn.

Formative assessments can take the shape of observations, quizzes, class discussions, and formative writing assignments. These assessments can be informal "benchmark assessments," such as a quick quiz given in class, or more formal, such as a written response.

These assessments are often used to inform the teacher's instruction, as they note academic progress throughout the learning process, so teachers can address students struggling with what will be assessed at the end of the unit, semester, or course.

### Summative assessment

A summative assessment, on the other hand, is a final evaluation of student learning. It is used to evaluate student progress and understanding and to measure the effectiveness of instruction.

Summative assessments are often described as an "assessment _of_ learning" because it is used to evaluate the learning process and determine student progress. Unlike formative assessments, summative assessments are used to grade student outcomes with finality.

Common summative assessments include such as tests, exams, and projects. These assessments are often formal, such as an in-class written exam or a final project. Summative assessments are typically used at the end of a unit or course to evaluate student understanding and progress. Upon reflecting on student grades, teachers can use summative assessments to provide feedback on performance.

## **Performance assessment**

Performance assessments are an assessment of student learning that is based on the demonstration of a skill or knowledge rather than recall. They are used to go beyond information recall. These assessments specifically evaluate student understanding and application of a concept or skill.

![Performance assessment](/images/blog/14/19-1.webp)

Presentations, lab reports, and portfolios can be categorized under performance assessments. Students can then see how their active engagement in the learning activity can lead to a larger outcome or product—that may even reflect something they would be doing in a future profession.

These comprehensive applications challenge students to demonstrate their understanding in a real-world setting and allow teachers to see how well students can apply their knowledge in different contexts.

## **Self-assessment**

Self-assessments are reflective, metacognitive assessments that are completed by the student, for the student. They promote student ownership of their learning and help students understand their learning process.

Students tend to enjoy self-assessments because personal introspection makes them feel more connected to the learning happening in school. It helps them see the bigger picture of why they are engaging in learning and how it will help them grow as individuals.

Popular self-assessment options include journals, reflective prompts, and goal setting. They allow students to think critically about their learning, set goals for improvement, monitor their efforts, and continue this cycle of self-improvement.

## **Peer assessment**

Peer assessments are designed for students to provide constructive feedback to their peers. They are used to promote collaboration and provide feedback on student learning.

Peer editing and peer evaluations are often part of a revision phase of a larger assessment. They encourage students to receive feedback from their peers, learn from one another, and make necessary enhancements to their work for improvement.

## **Creative assessment**

Creative assessments allow students to express their understanding and knowledge creatively and uniquely. Students typically enjoy these forms of assessment because they may appeal to a talent or interest that they are excited to share.

![Creative assessment](/images/blog/14/20.webp)

Students may demonstrate their learning of a larger idea through artwork, poetry, music, drama, videography, photography, podcasting, etcetera. Creative assessments allow students to use their imagination and creativity to communicate their understanding and skills in a way that is meaningful to them.

Teachers then have the opportunity to see their student's aptitudes and strengths, thus informing future learning opportunities that may appeal to student preferences.

## **Choice assessment**

Choice assessments are assessments that allow students to choose the format in which they will demonstrate their understanding and knowledge. These types of assessments can take many forms, such as creative assessment choice boards, written essays, oral presentations, or other projects on a topic of choice or in a format of choice.

Incorporating creative and choice assessments into the classroom allows for a more diverse and inclusive approach to assessment. It also allows students to showcase their unique strengths and abilities in a way that traditional assessments may not—these assessments allow students to choose the format that best suits their learning styles.

Any sort of choice in the classroom promotes student ownership of their learning and can increase motivation and engagement. Using creative and choice assessments embodies a more student-centered approach to learning, where students are actively engaged in the learning process and take ownership of their education.

Creative and choice assessments are an important addition to the variety of assessment types that can be used in the classroom. Creative and choice assessments especially allow students to showcase their unique talents and interests, which can boost their self-esteem in the classroom.

By incorporating these types of assessments into the classroom, educators can target their students' needs, interests, learning styles, and preferences, to help them to achieve their full potential.

## **Conclusion**

Assessment is an essential aspect of education and plays a crucial role in unlocking the potential of students. By using a variety of assessment types, educators will have a more holistic understanding of their students and be able to specify their instruction to better suit the needs of their specific group of students.

Diagnostic, criterion-referenced, norm-referenced, formative, summative, performance, creative, choice, self, and peer assessment are all important tools that can be used to evaluate student learning and improve teaching methods. By using these different types of assessments in a balanced way, students and teachers alike can maximize learning opportunities in the classroom.

By understanding the value and function of each type of assessment, educators can create a more effective and inclusive learning environment for their students.
