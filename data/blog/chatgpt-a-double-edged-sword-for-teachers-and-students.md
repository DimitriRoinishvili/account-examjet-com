An innovative AI chatbot could make it dangerously easy for students to cheat on tests and assignments that entail writing answers.

Called ChatGPT, the AI program is designed by Open AI and has gone viral this week.

ChatGPT can answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and even reject inappropriate requests - all of which make it a powerful tool for students to cheat on written exams or homework. It would be almost impossible for teachers or professors to detect whether a student is using ChatGPT, as the program can craft replies with the same grammar and syntax that humans use.

This has led some, like Kevin Bryan, a University of Toronto professor, to say "You can no longer give take-home exams/homework."

Cheating with ChatGPT could have devastating implications, as students may be able to cheat their way through tests and school work without being caught. This could lead to a rise in academic dishonesty and negatively affect the quality of education.

# **How students can cheat using these tools?**

Students can use ChatGPT to cheat in a variety of ways, such as asking the program for answers or copy-pasting whole passages from its generated text. They may also use the AI's natural language processing capabilities to craft convincing replies that appear human-written. These deceptively sophisticated responses could easily fool teachers and professors who are unaware of the technology.

# **What can teachers do to prevent cheating?**

To prevent students from cheating with ChatGPT and other AI tools, teachers need to put in place measures like:

-   Randomized question sets
-   Timed assessments
-   And proctored exams

These measures are designed to limit the ability of students to cheat by using AI tools. Additionally, teachers should also educate their students on the importance of academic integrity and the consequences of cheating.

Finally, it is important to make sure that any use of AI technology in exams or assignments is made clear to both the teacher and the student. This will ensure that everyone involved is aware of when AI-enabled systems are being used and that all students are playing on a level playing field.

To prevent cheating, teachers must also take steps to remain vigilant and ensure that written assignments are original. They should also be aware of any suspicious behavior from students, such as **sudden high test scores** or **unexplained changes in writing style**.

# **On which types of exams can students cheat using AI tools?**

Students can use AI tools to cheat on any type of written exam or assignment, including:

1.  Multiple choice quizzes
2.  Essay questions
3.  Research papers

Additionally, they may also try to use the technology to game online tests and exams, such as those administered via virtual environments like Zoom or Google Meet. In some cases, students may even use AI-based tools to generate fake answers or copy work from other students.

# **7 strategies to avoid cheating**

Instructors can take advantage of the built-in tools in their institution's **student assessment solutions** to reduce cheating during online exams, even without having to buy pricey virtual proctoring software.

## **Create questions that require higher-order thinking**

Rather than asking students questions that can be easily answered by web searches or textbooks, have them answer those on the higher levels of analysis and evaluation (Bloom, 1956). It will become more difficult for students to simply find answers from their peers or "Google" when they must explain, analyze, construct, evaluate and authentically demonstrate their knowledge. This way we ensure a deeper understanding of course content is attained.

## **Use varied question types**

To challenge your students, avoid using exclusively multiple-choice or true/false questions on exams. By replacing some of these with open-ended inquiries, it becomes harder for pupils to replicate their peers' answers verbatim and encourages them to come up with unique explanations that demonstrate a genuine understanding of the material. This way, they must provide specific details and meaningful narratives in support of their response.

## **Restrict testing window**

To mimic the on-campus atmosphere for exams, it is important to set a designated testing slot for each course online. Scheduling every student to begin and end their exam around the same time will help keep everyone on track. If there are students in different time zones, create three separate test timeslots that accommodate all of them! This strategy can ensure fair and equal exam opportunities regardless of location or circumstance.

To ensure fairness and accuracy, the online exams should provide adequate time for those who have studied and are knowledgeable of the material to be successful in their assessment. Make sure you establish appropriate timing restrictions that give students with learning accommodations more time if needed.

Do not extend too much extra time though as it may allow unprepared students to search for answers during the exam period.

## **Set up the exam to show one question at a time**

To stop students from rapidly glancing through all the test questions or having multiple tabs open to investigate answers, select a testing setting that only displays one query at once. This will also bar family and friends from assisting with certain queries.

## **Offer different versions of the same test**

To ensure academic integrity, it is wise to have multiple versions of the same test. This way, even if students are taking their tests in the same location or time zone, they will not all be receiving a singular set of questions. Having different sets of tests for students at various times may also help improve fairness and accuracy.

## **Protect test question answers**

By limiting students to simply viewing the questions they got wrong when requesting a review of their exam, you can limit any risk of them copying and distributing your test material for future courses. This will help ensure that all exams remain confidential and secure.

# **Bottom Line**

Cheating has always been a concern for educators, but with the rise of AI-based tools, it is more important than ever to take precautions. By implementing these seven strategies into your online assessment, you can help ensure that all students are given an equal opportunity to succeed and that no one gains an unfair advantage due to cheating.

Ultimately, by creating a secure, fair, and equitable testing environment, you can protect the integrity of your online courses.

The key is to create an atmosphere of trust and respect, where students know they are expected to demonstrate their knowledge without fear of being caught cheating. This way, everyone will be able to learn in a safe and encouraging setting.
