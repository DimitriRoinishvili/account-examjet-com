## What Makes an Evaluation Complex?

The complexity of many subjects can make it difficult to accurately test for proficiency.

One very common myth is that a digital assessment is inferior to a physical assessment for complex topics. However, this isn't true.

Online assessment software can take difficult topics to test and break them down into components that are both intuitive and allow for a more accurate assessment of student learning.

### Simplifying Complexity

Even the most complex subjects can be made simple by an efficient assessment process.

When developing testing systems, it's important to keep simplification as the core goal of your approach.

Many schools are seeing that with the right assessment software, they can create online assessments that will accurately test the knowledge of complex topics.

This means that each online assessment becomes more effective and the ultimate goal of ensuring students progress in their knowledge of a subject is more effectively accomplished.

The feedback that you gain through your learning management system can be crucial in providing you with an understanding of how effective your online assessments are and how accurately they are testing the knowledge.

The data that you gain about your students' success or difficulty with excelling at their tests can help you as the educator to teach better testing skills and to know how to address knowledge gaps.

### Steps to Simplify and Assess Complex Topics

1.  **Value flexibility in learning**. Keep in mind that the learning experience is helped by flexible approaches to tests. Not all subjects are tested the same way. Fortunately, with platforms operating online, you can adjust your approach to whatever subject you are teaching at that time.
2.  **Test according to student performance**. Every student will have different levels of test-taking skills. Utilizing an approach that optimizes their ability to be accurately assessed will allow you to create better assessment methods with each new test. If students are hitting certain points and missing others, it could be indicative of a learning gap and possible difficulty with the larger, more complex concepts that are being tested.
3.  **Use multiple choice appropriately**Multiple-choice questions can be a great way to assess student performance if they are used correctly. Some criticism of using this method states that it only shows that students can guess well. This potential issue is easily avoided. If multiple-choice tests are designed in a way that shows that students understand the concepts then they can be very useful in assessment tests.
