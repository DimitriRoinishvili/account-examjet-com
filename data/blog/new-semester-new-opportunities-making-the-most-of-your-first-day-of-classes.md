It's back to school time! The anticipation of the first day of class is just as real to educators as it is to students. You want to plan the right lesson, master your introduction, review course information, set expectations, and set the tone for your classroom community—all to make a good impression.

An easy way to get past the first-day jitters is a simple change in mindset: new semester, new opportunities. The great part about teaching is that each semester or school year, you have the opportunity to start fresh with new students, a fresh classroom, and a rejuvenated sense of creativity.

Here are a few strategies for educators who want to nail the first day:

## Plan the Right Lesson

Apart from learning students' names, your first class meeting should have the following goals: engage, excite, and inform all your students.

That being said, the first day of class is an opportunity for teachers to positively impact student perceptions of your course and set the tone for the semester. To make the most of this opportunity, it's important to plan a lesson that is engaging, interactive, and relevant to the students. Consider the students' level of understanding and tailor the lesson to their needs.

### Lesson planning tips

-   Consider using a "hook" or an interesting activity to grab students' attention and engage them in the lesson. For example, you could start the class with a real-world problem or interesting question, interesting facts related to the subject matter, or an interactive game that connects to the material.
-   Use a variety of teaching methods to cater to different learning styles. For example, you could include visual aids, group work, discussions, and hands-on activities in your lesson. This can also provide you with a better sense of how each student learns, right from the start.
-   Make sure the lesson is relevant to the student's lives and interests. For example, you can connect the lesson to a current event, or use examples that are relatable to the students.

## Master Your Introduction

The introduction is the first impression you will make on your students. Make sure you are prepared and confident in what you will share during your first meeting with students. Introduce yourself as the teacher and explain your background, qualifications, and teaching philosophy.

### Introduction tips

-   Practice your introduction beforehand to feel more confident and at ease on the first day of class. Remember, it's okay to plan, but students value an authentic teacher.
-   Aside from your teaching, add three statements that are interesting about you, so your students can get to know you as a person.
-   Use a positive and enthusiastic tone when introducing yourself and the course.
-   Provide a clear and concise overview of the course, its objectives, and expectations.
-   Remind students that you are there to support them and that you are looking forward to working with them throughout the semester.
-   Encourage them to reach out to you if they have any questions or concerns and to communicate with you regularly.

## Review Course Information

Before the first day of class, review the course information and syllabus. This will help you to be better prepared to answer any questions that students may have. Provide students with a copy of the syllabus and explain the expectations for the course.

### Course preview tips

-   Prepare a handout or a slide presentation that includes all the necessary information about the course, such as the syllabus, schedule, assignments, and evaluation criteria.
-   Be ready to answer any questions students might have about the course. Reach out to colleagues who have taught the course or make your running list of some frequently asked questions.
-   Make sure to go over the course policies, such as attendance, participation, and late work policy.
-   Remind students of the resources available to them, such as office hours, tutoring, and extra help sessions. Encourage them to take advantage of these resources and not hesitate to reach out for help when needed.
-   Introduce students to your classroom. If your course requires equipment or special seating arrangements, give them a tour!
-   Assess their understanding. Giving students a syllabus quiz can ensure student understanding of what is to come in the course.

## Set Course Expectations

The first day of class is a great opportunity to set expectations for the course and how learning will take place in the classroom. Explain the policies, procedures, and expectations for the course, so both teacher and student are on the same page. Discuss the importance of attendance, participation, and timely submission of assignments. But remember to be encouraging—these rules are in place to help them succeed.

### Course expectations tips

-   Use the first day of class to establish a clear set of expectations students need for the course. For example, you could explain that you expect students to attend every class, participate in discussions, and submit assignments on time.
-   Start establishing routines. For example, if students are to look at the board and write down their assignment for each day, introduce this practice as early as possible.
-   Make sure to explain the consequences of not meeting these expectations, such as lower grades or disciplinary action so there are no surprises down the road.
-   Encourage students to take responsibility for their learning and to advocate for themselves. Show them how to seek help if they need it.

## Set the Tone for the Learning Environment

The first day is also an opportunity to set the tone for the learning environment. Encourage students to participate and be active in the learning process. Creating a positive and inclusive atmosphere where all students feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions takes time, but teacher efforts should start on the first day. Try using the following strategies:

### Tips for setting the tone

-   Create a positive and inclusive atmosphere by using inclusive language, encouraging participation, and creating opportunities for students to share their ideas and opinions.
-   Start your course with a collaborative task, so students become more comfortable socially from the start.
-   Remind students that education is a journey and that it's important to enjoy the process of learning. As a teacher, you are there to guide them and help them achieve their goals.
-   Encourage active listening and respect for different perspectives.
-   Model the behavior you expect from your students, such as being punctual, respectful, and engaged in the learning process.

## Need some suggestions? Here are some tried and true activities

From elementary teaching to college teaching, the first week of class is crucial. Students learn best when they feel comfortable around new classmates, empowered to seek assistance, engaged in the material, and take ownership of their learning.

Engage students in just a few minutes with some fun questions, games, and interactive engagement with the course on day one to set the tone for the year.

### Icebreaker activities

Get your students talking. Oftentimes, students are afraid to be vulnerable and put themselves out there in the classroom. So, educators need to teach students how to get to know each other and feel more comfortable in the class. Some whole class activities include:

-   Two Truths and a Lie: Students introduce themselves by sharing two truths about themselves and one lie, and the class has to guess which statement is the lie.
-   Find Someone Who: Students walk around the class and find someone who fits certain criteria (e.g. has been to a foreign country, has a certain hobby, etc.) and write down their name.
-   Human Scavenger Hunt: Students are given a list of questions and have to find someone in the class who can answer them.

### Team-building activities

Help students develop teamwork skills and build a sense of comradery in the classroom. Nothing gets kids excited—and young adults—like a game. Even if they don't perfectly align with course content, it is so important to build a sense of class community. Get the entire class involved with some of these school activities:

-   Marshmallow Challenge: Students are given a bag of marshmallows, spaghetti, and tape, and have to build the tallest structure they can within a certain time limit.
-   Escape Room: Create a simple Escape Room type of activity where students have to work together to solve puzzles and find clues to "escape" the room.
-   Group Jigsaw: Divide the class into small groups and give each group a jigsaw puzzle to complete. Once they finish, they can share their finished puzzle with the class.

### Class introduction activities

These activities can help students get a better understanding of the course, future content, necessary skills, and the teacher's expectations. Some examples include:

-   Class Contract: Have students work in small groups to create a class contract that outlines the expectations and rules for the class.
-   Course Overview: Create a visual representation of the course structure, such as a concept map or a timeline, and have students create their own representation of the course.
-   Pre-Assessment: Collect information early. Gage the knowledge students have in relation to your course before you start teaching. Make it interesting with a game-like structure such as Kahoot!
-   Self-Assessment: Have students complete a self-assessment survey or questionnaire to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles.

### Goal-setting activities

Give students the opportunity to set personal and academic goals for the semester. This will help them feel more connected to their learning and serve as a motivator throughout the course—with consistent relation. Some examples include:

-   Future Me: Have students write a letter to their future selves, outlining their goals for the semester and what they hope to achieve by the end.
-   Vision Board: Have students create a vision board that represents their academic and personal goals for the semester.
-   SMART Goals: Have students set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals for the semester and create a plan to achieve them.

## Practical tips for teachers

It's important to remember that the first day of class is not only about making a good impression on your students, but also about making a good impression on yourself. It can be easy to get caught up in the stress and pressure of the first day, but by approaching it with a positive mindset and a renewed sense of excitement for your pedagogy, you can set yourself up for success and make the most of the new semester.

As a teacher, you know that the first day of class is not just about the first day, it's about setting a foundation for the _whole_ semester. By taking the time to plan, review, and prepare, you can ensure that both you and your students have a clear understanding of what to expect in this class and how to succeed. This in turn can lead to a more productive and enjoyable semester for everyone involved.

Remember that teaching is a dynamic profession, and it's important to be flexible, open-minded, and adaptable. Be ready to make adjustments as needed and to adjust your teaching style to best meet the needs of your students—and to let your students in on any changes as well.

With the right mindset and strategies, you can make the most of the first day and create a positive and productive learning environment for your students.

## Conclusion

The first day can be a daunting experience for both teachers and students, but with the right mindset and strategies, educators can make the most of this opportunity to start the course off on the right foot.

By planning the right lesson, mastering the introduction, reviewing course information, setting expectations, and creating a positive classroom community, educators can make the most of the first day and set the tone for a successful semester.

Icebreakers, team-building activities, class introduction activities, and goal-setting activities can get your students engaged and comfortable. But these activities don't need to end on the first day. Some teachers integrate them throughout the first week or first month or sprinkle them throughout the school year to keep things light.

Remember, each semester is a new opportunity to start fresh and make a positive impact on the lives of your new students. Keep an open mind and be ready for new opportunities!
