## **Publish Tests in ExamJet**

Make your test open to the public with specified preferences and time restrictions. By blending multiple question banks and student groups, you give yourself the flexibility to select a grading scale that suits your course objectives and to decide when the test should be available for students to take it.

**This way, accuracy, and control can be maintained in one efficient process.**

### **Core Features**

-   Tests will have a specific grading system. And with that right grading system, you can easily provide the grades students are looking for and ensure they’re completely accurate.
-   Putting Time restrictions on your tests will ease your burden and keep students focused and on task when trying to get work done promptly.
-   Plus, you can blend multiple question banks and student groups, giving assignments more flexibility since all questions don’t have to be the same for everyone. As a result, each person can have their own unique experience that still meets educational standards.
-   Therefore, these strategies are essential tools many teachers use now to give students the best learning opportunities available.
